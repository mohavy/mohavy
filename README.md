### Hello, I am mohavy!

I am interested in Space, Science, Engineering and related fields. There are quite a few repositories here that I started and never finished, and part of the reason for that is I did not have the skills to finish them before, but now that I have more experience maybe(?) I'll finish them.

Repositories I enjoyed making or are a little fun:
